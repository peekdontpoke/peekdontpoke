- 👋 Hi, I’m @peekdontpoke. English is my only language. Complete beginner. Less than skilled, slow learner, you get it!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... QB64 programming or Windows 10 to capture and display data from USB inputs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...QB64 the hard way! Ha!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...I desperately need help trying to figure out how to convert legacy QBASIC code to QB64.
- I have most of the original code conversion (charting) completed, but am having trouble getting RS232 data into a USB port,
- reading those data, then writing them to a file. Yes, Windows Device Manager confirms USB port
- works and RS-232 data stream is running thru a PRolific hardware converter, so troubles are in software (QB64 code and syntax).  
- 📫 How to reach me ...asezaspie@hotmail.com
